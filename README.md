Image Retargeting using Seam Carving. Guided by salience map
=========================

Using salience map to inform seam carving.

Makes use of Michael Rubinstein's seam carving implementation - available here: http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/

Makes use of Graph-Based Visual Saliency - available here: http://www.vision.caltech.edu/~harel/share/gbvs.php
_NB:_ GBVS needs to be *installed*. See readme in that projector for details

rearrangeImageBasedOnClicks() can also be used to move objects in an image by introducing seams to the left/right/above/below the object until it's in the desired position.
